Bridge design pattern – Real-world example in C#

Consider software with a new version named “ShareJornal“. It allows users to register and write a few things about their daily routine and interactions with their close friends, just like a daily journal. This software will require no user authentication or instantiation, and you would consider that the user will be entered immediately into the system for simplicity.

The previous version of the software called “DailyJournal” is not discarded yet, and the users can also access the pages on the previous version. So try to think about it a little bit how you can fulfill this requirement with the help of the Bridge design pattern.

Output:
